# RTX-Remix-Downloader
An alternative to the https://github.com/Kowlin/RTX-Remix-Downloader
## Distinct features:
- Manages and updates bridge-remix and dxvk-remix separately, only downloads those needs to be updated.
- Supports managing both release and debug optimized builds separately.
- It doesn't download the release version from rtx-remix repo since the usd folder is included with newer dxvk-remix builds.
- It's written in powershell and powershell sucks
